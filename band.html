                    <p>Alkaline trio were originally founded in late 1996 by guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba, bassist Rob Doran, and drummer Glenn Porter, in Chicago Illinois. 
                        The band released its debut single, <i>Sundials</i>, in 1997. But shortly after its release, 
                        Doran departed from the band and was replaced by Dan Andriano. <br>
                        The band recorded their sedond EP, <i>For Your Lungs Only</i> in 1998, and went on to release their debut studio album, <i>Goddamnit</i> later that same year. <br>
                        
                        2000 saw the release of their second full length studio album <i>Maybe I'll Catch Fire</i> which included one of their most popular
                        hits to date <i>radio</i>, still a firm favourite at live shows. <br>
                        Soon after this, drummer Glenn Porter left the trio and was replaced by Mike Felumlee with whom they went on to record
                        their third studio album <i>From here to infirmary.</i>
                        This album inspired music videos for the singles <i>Stupid</i> Kid and <i>Private Eye</i> 
                        and was the band's first album to reach above the Billboard top 200 mark and the first to gross six figures in sales.

                    <p>Shortly after the release of <i>From here to infirmary</i> the trio went through their fourth and final change to the lineup with the 
                        departure of drummer Mike Felumlee. He was subsequently replaced by Derek Grant. <br>
                        In 2003 with Derek in the band they recorded their fourth album, <i>Good Mourning.</i> With the albums launch single <i>we've had enough</i> seeing a similar
                        success to their previous single <i>stupid kid.</i> 
                        Good mourning brought a new sound to that of the previous albums with the band focusing on greater production levels. <br>
                        In 2005 came the bands fifth studio album <i>Crimson</i> with the opening track <i>Time to waste</i> being released as the albums launch single. Crimson
                        also saw the release of the song <i>Sadie</i> often hailed as the bands greatest work to date. <br>
                        With each of the band members working on their own side projects it would be three years before the next album was released.
                        In 2008 along came <i>agony and irony,</i> Their sixth studio album. 
                        Matt Skiba stated that the band set out to record an "anthemic hard rock record", and essentially brought another new sound and dimension to 
                        the trios catalogue of music.

                    <p> During a concert in May 2009, the trio revealed that they would be releasing new material through their own label later in the year.  
                        In November 2009, the band announced that they would be releasing their next studio album on their own newly formed label, <i>Heart & Skull</i>, a joint venture with Epitaph Records. <br>
                        In the same article, Skiba announced that the new album <i>This addiction</i> would be released on February 23, 2010.  
                        The trio went back to their home in Chicago to record This Addiction working hard to get back to their roots, after the previous
                        three albums were recorded in L.A. <br>
                        In 2013 came the release of the bands eigth studio album <i>My shame is true</i> peaking at number 24 on the billboard charts.
                        Inspired by a recent romantic break-up, Skiba described the record as a "pseudo-concept album" and a catharsis, stating, "I just wrote this one more as a love letter to my ex-girlfriend, 
                        or an apology note set to music." Following the album's release, Skiba noted that the album brought the couple back together. <br>
                        With the trio still working heavily on side projects it would be five years before the bands latest release and ninth studio album
                        <i>Is thing cursed?</i> featuring the single <i>Blckbird.</i> After the five year wait the album was received with positive reviews being described 
                        as "recapturing the spirit of earlier recordings".
