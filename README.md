## User Experience - UX

 My website has been designed for current and potential fans of the band **__Alkaline Trio,__** 
 the website has been designed for those who would like:
  * Some information on the band members and the history of the band.
  * Information on any upcoming tour dates.
  * Links to the bands social media pages including:
    * Facebook
    * Twitter
    * Instagram
    * Youtube
  * To listen to the bands music and see their discography.
  * To contact the band.<br>

They will also be able to sign up to a news letter to keep up to date with all the current news, tour dates and new music coming out.

## User Stories

* As a fan or potential fan of the band visiting this website reguarly, or for the first time I would like:
    * To easily navigate the site to get to the relevant page.
    * The site to be responsive to whichever device I am currently using to visit the site. 
    * To find the contrast of colours throughout the site pleasing on the eye and easy to distinguish between different features.
    * To locate the bands social media links and open them in a new browser whilst still remaining on their website.
    * To find information about the band, so I can learn a little about their history and the current members.
    * To see the most up to date tour dates and be able to book tickets through the website.
    * To sign up to a newsletter so I an be kept up to date wiht the most recent news regarding the band via email. 
    * To listen to music from different albums and watch videos of the bands singles.
    * To contact the band.

* As a member of the band or part of their management I would like this website to:
    * Promote exactly who we are in a clear and pleasing way.
    * Promote any upcoming tour dates we have and get ticket sales directly through the website.
    * Promote any new music videos we have released and allow visitors to listen to music from our past albums.
    * Give fans the chance to sign up to a news letter to keep them up to date with the latest news which may include future tour dates
    which in turn will help generate more ticket sales.
    * Keep the website upto date and engaging so that fans will want to return again and again.
    * Allow our fans to contact us by sending a direct message through the contact page.

## Wireframes

To make my wireframes I have used balsamiq. I did one for each page and did a design for larger screens and smaller screens to show how the 
site will be responsive to screen size and change accordingly. The links to each one are below.<br> **__For easier viewing I would recommend clicking the 
dowload button as they appear much larger when viewed through github__**

## Design

  * ### Color scheme
     * The main colors I have used in this project are a shade of red (#ba1626), black and gold (#d3ab78) and also a slightly off white (#f0f0f0).
       I chose these colors because the band have often used a black and red theme for album covers, and the newest album also incorporates
       gold. I chose the off white for the header element and also the background color for the history section on the band page
       because I found it made the paragraphs of text easy to read and also contrasts nicely with the rest of the page as a header.

  * ### Typography
     * The two fonts I have used are *Fjalla One* and *Lora*. Both fonts have been imported from google fonts. I have used *sans-serif* as a backup 
       font incase the other two for some reason don't load correctly with the site.
     * I used Lora for the header font and also the paragraphs of text in the history section of the band page. Fjalla One was used for everything else.
     * I picked these fonts because Lora is a clear and easy to read font so works well for the larger blocks of text and also had the look I wanted for the 
       header when typed in all capitals. I then picked Fjalla One because I think the two fonts compliment each other nicely and look attractive
       togehter on the site.
