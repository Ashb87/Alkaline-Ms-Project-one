## User Experience - UX

 My website has been designed for current and potential fans of the band **__Alkaline Trio,__** 
 the website has been designed for those who would like:
  * Some information on the band members and the history of the band.
  * Information on any upcoming tour dates.
  * Links to the bands social media pages including:
    * Facebook
    * Twitter
    * Instagram
    * Youtube
  * To listen to the bands music and see their discography.
  * To contact the band.<br>

They will also be able to sign up to a news letter to keep up to date with all the current news, tour dates and new music coming out.

## User Stories

* As a fan or potential fan of the band visiting this website reguarly, or for the first time I would like:
    * To easily navigate the site to get to the relevant page.
    * The site to be responsive to whichever device I am currently using to visit the site. 
    * To find the contrast of colours throughout the site pleasing on the eye and easy to distinguish between different features.
    * To locate the bands social media links and open them in a new browser whilst still remaining on their website.
    * To find information about the band, so I can learn a little about their history and the current members.

    * Promote any new music videos we have released and allow visitors to listen to music from our past albums.

    * Allow our fans to contact us by sending a direct message through the contact page.

## Design

I want the design of the website to reflect the band and their style and so will choose colors that compliment this well. It should be easy 
to navigate and to have a clear meaning to each page of the site. 
I want to keep a consistent theme throughout the website by using the same color combinations on every page but also making each page slightly
unique by changing which colors are used where. For example background and heading colors. I want the site to be attractive for the user and make
them want to return ot the site again.


  * ### Color scheme
     * The main colors I have used in this project are a shade of red (#ba1626), black and gold (#d3ab78) and also a slightly off white (#f0f0f0).
       I chose these colors because the band have often used a black and red theme for album covers, and the newest album also incorporates
       gold. I chose the off white for the header element and also the background color for the history section on the band page
       because I found it made the paragraphs of text easy to read and also contrasts nicely with the rest of the page as a header. 
     * Both the red and gold shades were found using the color selector on chrome dev tools. I used the selector to find the correct shade of each color
       that I felt complimented the site well.

  * ### Typography
     * The two fonts I have used are *Fjalla One* and *Lora*. Both fonts have been imported from google fonts. I have used *sans-serif* as a backup 
       font incase the other two for some reason don't load correctly with the site.
     * I used Lora for the header font and also the paragraphs of text in the history section of the band page. Fjalla One was used for everything else.
     * I picked these fonts because Lora is a clear and easy to read font so works well for the larger blocks of text and also had the look I wanted for the 
       header when typed in all capitals. I then picked Fjalla One because I think the two fonts compliment each other nicely and look attractive
       togehter on the site.

  * ### Imagery
     * The images I have used for this project are to enhance the visual aspect of the specific page they are related to. The band page with information
     about the band members and their history has various pictures of the members either on their own or all together. The music page has
     an image of each of the album covers listed on that page. For the tour page I have used an image for the background of the band playing
     at a live show. For larger screens the image is displayed just once, for mobile devices the image is repeated as you scroll down the screen.
     I decided to do this rather than no-repeat because the image looked way too stretched and the bottom and top blend very well together giving it 
     a very natural look for small screen viewing.

  * ### Wireframes

To make my wireframes I have used balsamiq. I did one for each page and did a design for larger screens and smaller screens to show how the 
site will be responsive to screen size and change accordingly. The links to each one are below.<br> **__For easier viewing I would recommend clicking the 
dowload button above the wireframe image as they appear much larger when viewed directly through github__**

I mostly kept the design of the website very similar to that of my wireframes. I decided to change the navbar and only use the burger icon for the 
smaller screen devices because I preferred the look of having each page link available to see in the header on larger screens. I also centered
the social links at the bottom of the page with the sign up button above, on all screen sizes rather than just mobile devices.
The biggest change I made was to the music page. I decided to give each album its own row across the whole screen rather than have three side by side
as I did in the wireframes. I chose to do this because I wanted to get the image, text and music player for each album on the screen without it feeling
too squashed or crowded.

## Features

  * ### Header and Footer - consistent on all pages
    * Responsive Navbar that collapses to a burger icon for smaller screens.
    * A sign up button that when clicked displays a modal with a form to fill in for users of the site to recieve news and updates about the band.
      Currently due to the scope of the project, when the form is submitted nothing will happen.
    * Social media links for the band, including **Facebook**, **Twitter**, **YouTube** and **Instagram** These will open a new page and link 
      to the bands actual social media pages.

  * ### Home page
    * A video using embedded code from YouTube for one of the bands singles.
    * An image promoting the new album with a link directing the user to this album on the spotify website.
    * A link giving the user the option to follow the band on spotify.

  * ### Band page
    * An image of each of the band members with their date of birth and which instrument the play
    * A history section about the band with images and text giving information on the history of the bands lineup changes and albums produced.

  * ### Music page
    * A section for six of the bands albums, each section inlcuding a picture of the album cover, the title and release year, and an audio
      card for each album with controls. These include all the tracks for each album, which allows the user to listen to the albums as they please. 

  * ### Tour page
    * A background image of the band playing live intended to add excitement when buying tickets for one of their concerts.
    * Tour dates with city, venue and opening times, with either a *book now* or *sold out* button.
    * The book now button will direct the user to the ticketmaster home page.
    * The sold out button is deactivated and can not be clicked.

  * ### Contact page
    * A form allowing the user to contact the band with a direct message, each field must be filled in before clicking the submit button.
      Due to the scope of this project, when the form is submitted nothing will happen.  
      
## Features I would like to implement 
With the addition of javascript and knowledge of back-end web development I would like to add these further features to the website.
  * When a user signs up with the sign up form on screen they would receive a welcome email and then be included in all future emails 
    for news and updates regarding the band. 
  * When a user fills in the contact form the message would be sent to an email address for the band and management to see allowing a response 
    and or reply.
  * The tour page would be used for a genuine tour with users being able to book their tickets directly through the website, and the buttons 
    changing from *book now* to *sold out* when all the tickets were gone.
  * A page for merchandise where users could browse items, add to a basket and pay for their items through the website. Followed up by a 
    confirmation of purchase email being sent to the user. 

## Technologies Used

  * [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
    * The project uses HTML5 to make up the basic elements and structure of the website.
  * [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
    * I have used CSS3 to add my own custom styling and to change any default bootstrap styling that didn't fit with the look of the website.
  * [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    * I used balsamiq to design and draw up my wireframes before starting the project.
  * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    * The Bootstrap framework was used to help build the responsive structure of the site and add default styling. 
    * It was also used to import JavaScript and Jquery which was used for the pop up modal sign up form and the collapsible navbar. 
  * [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    * This was used for the logos of the social media links in the footer of the website.  
  * [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * Google fonts was used throughout the project to import my selected fonts Lora and Fjalla-One.
  * [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    * Gitpod was the text editor I used to write all of my HTML and CSS code to style and structure the website.
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    * Git is used as version control software to add, commit and push code to my GitHub repository where the code is then stored.
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    * I have used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. GitHub pages has also been used to deploy my my live site.
  * [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
    * I have used Google chromes built in developer tools to help with the styling of the site, selecting colors and to help 
    fix any bugs I found.
