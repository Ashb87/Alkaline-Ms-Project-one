## User Experience - UX

 My website has been designed for current and potential fans of the band **__Alkaline Trio,__** 
 the website has been designed for those who would like:
  * Some information on the band members and the history of the band.
  * Information on any upcoming tour dates.
  * Links to the bands social media pages including:
    * Facebook
    * Twitter
    * Instagram
    * Youtube
  * To listen to the bands music and see their discography.
  * To contact the band.<br>

They will also be able to sign up to a news letter to keep up to date with all the current news, tour dates and new music coming out.

## User Stories

* As a fan or potential fan of the band visiting this website reguarly, or for the first time I would like:
    * To easily navigate the site to get to the relevant page.
    * The site to be responsive to whichever device I am currently using to visit the site. 
    * To find the contrast of colours throughout the site pleasing on the eye and easy to distinguish between different features.
    * To locate the bands social media links and open them in a new browser whilst still remaining on their website.
    * To find information about the band, so I can learn a little about their history and the current members.
    * To see the most up to date tour dates and be able to book tickets through the website.
    * To sign up to a newsletter so I an be kept up to date wiht the most recent news regarding the band via email. 
    * To listen to music from different albums and watch videos of the bands singles.
    * To contact the band.

* As a member of the band or part of their management I would like this website to:
    * Promote exactly who we are in a clear and pleasing way.
    * Promote any upcoming tour dates we have and get ticket sales directly through the website.
    * Promote any new music videos we have released and allow visitors to listen to music from our past albums.

    which in turn will help generate more ticket sales.
    * Keep the website upto date and engaging so that fans will want to return again and again.
    * Allow our fans to contact us by sending a direct message through the contact page.

## Wireframes

To make my wireframes I have used balsamiq. I did one for each page and did a design for larger screens and smaller screens to show how the 
site will be responsive to screen size and change accordingly. The links to each one are below.<br> **__For easier viewing I would recommend clicking the 
dowload button as they appear much larger when viewed through github__**

## Design

  * ### Color scheme
     * The main colors I have used in this project are a shade of red (#ba1626), black and gold (#d3ab78) and also a slightly off white (#f0f0f0).
       I chose these colors because the band have often used a black and red theme for album covers, and the newest album also incorporates
       gold. I chose the off white for the header element and also the background color for the history section on the band page
       because I found it made the paragraphs of text easy to read and also contrasts nicely with the rest of the page as a header.

  * ### Typography
     * The two fonts I have used are *Fjalla One* and *Lora*. Both fonts have been imported from google fonts. I have used *sans-serif* as a backup 
       font incase the other two for some reason don't load correctly with the site.
     * I used Lora for the header font and also the paragraphs of text in the history section of the band page. Fjalla One was used for everything else.
     * I picked these fonts because Lora is a clear and easy to read font so works well for the larger blocks of text and also had the look I wanted for the 
       header when typed in all capitals. I then picked Fjalla One because I think the two fonts compliment each other nicely and look attractive
       togehter on the site.

## Features

  * ### Header and Footer - consistent on all pages
    * Responsive Navbar that collapses to a burger icon for smaller screens.
    * A sign up button that when clicked displays a modal with a form to fill in for users of the site to recieve news and updates about the band.
      Currently due to the scope of the project, when the form is submitted nothing will happen.
    * Social media links for the band, including **Facebook**, **Twitter**, **YouTube** and **Instagram** These will open a new page and link 
      to the bands actual social media pages.

  * ### Home page
    * A video using embedded code from YouTube for one of the bands singles.
    * An image promoting the new album with a link directing the user to this album on the spotify website.
    * A link giving the user the option to follow the band on spotify.

  * ### Band page
    * An image of each of the band members with their date of birth and which instrument the play
    * A history section about the band with images and text giving information on the history of the bands lineup changes and albums produced.

  * ### Music page
    * A section for six of the bands albums, each section inlcuding a picture of the album cover, the title and release year, and an audio
      card for each album with controls. These include all the tracks for each album, which allows the user to listen to the albums as they please. 

  * ### Tour page
    * A background image of the band playing live intended to add excitement when buying tickets for one of their concerts.
    * Tour dates with city, venue and opening times, with either a *book now* or *sold out* button.
    * The book now button will direct the user to the ticketmaster home page.
    * The sold out button is deactivated and can not be clicked.

  * ### Contact page
    * A form allowing the user to contact the band with a direct message, each field must be filled in before clicking the submit button.
      Due to the scope of this project, when the form is submitted nothing will happen.  
      
## Features I would like to implement 
With the addition of javascript and knowledge of back-end web development I would like to add these further features to the website.
  * When a user signs up with the sign up form on screen they would receive a welcome email and then be included in all future emails 
    for news and updates regarding the band. 
  * When a user fills in the contact form the message would be sent to an email address for the band and management to see allowing a response 
    and or reply.
  * The tour page would be used for a genuine tour with users being able to book their tickets directly through the website, and the buttons 
    changing from *book now* to *sold out* when all the tickets were gone.
  * A page for merchandise where users could browse items, add to a basket and pay for their items through the website. Followed up by a 
    confirmation of purchase email being sent to the user.
