## Design

I want the design of the website to reflect the band and their style and so will choose colors that compliment this well. It should be easy 
to navigate and to have a clear meaning to each page of the site. 
I want to keep a consistent theme throughout the website by using the same color combinations on every page but also making each page slightly
unique by changing which colors are used where. For example background and heading colors. I want the site to be attractive for the user and make
them want to return ot the site again.


  * ### Color scheme
     * The main colors I have used in this project are a shade of red (#ba1626), black and gold (#d3ab78) and also a slightly off white (#f0f0f0).
       I chose these colors because the band have often used a black and red theme for album covers, and the newest album also incorporates
       gold. I chose the off white for the header element and also the background color for the history section on the band page
       because I found it made the paragraphs of text easy to read and also contrasts nicely with the rest of the page as a header. 
     * Both the red and gold shades were found using the color selector on chrome dev tools. I used the selector to find the correct shade of each color
       that I felt complimented the site well.

  * ### Typography
     * The two fonts I have used are *Fjalla One* and *Lora*. Both fonts have been imported from google fonts. I have used *sans-serif* as a backup 
       font incase the other two for some reason don't load correctly with the site.
     * I used Lora for the header font and also the paragraphs of text in the history section of the band page. Fjalla One was used for everything else.
     * I picked these fonts because Lora is a clear and easy to read font so works well for the larger blocks of text and also had the look I wanted for the 
       header when typed in all capitals. I then picked Fjalla One because I think the two fonts compliment each other nicely and look attractive
       togehter on the site.

  * ### Imagery
     * The images I have used for this project are to enhance the visual aspect of the specific page they are related to. The band page with information
     about the band members and their history has various pictures of the members either on their own or all together. The music page has
     an image of each of the album covers listed on that page. For the tour page I have used an image for the background of the band playing
     at a live show. For larger screens the image is displayed just once, for mobile devices the image is repeated as you scroll down the screen.
     I decided to do this rather than no-repeat because the image looked way too stretched and the bottom and top blend very well together giving it 
     a very natural look for small screen viewing.

  * ### Wireframes

To make my wireframes I have used balsamiq. I did one for each page and did a design for larger screens and smaller screens to show how the 
site will be responsive to screen size and change accordingly. The links to each one are below.<br> **__For easier viewing I would recommend clicking the 
dowload button above the wireframe image as they appear much larger when viewed directly through github__**

I mostly kept the design of the website very similar to that of my wireframes. I decided to change the navbar and only use the burger icon for the 
smaller screen devices because I preferred the look of having each page link available to see in the header on larger screens. I also centered
the social links at the bottom of the page with the sign up button above, on all screen sizes rather than just mobile devices.
The biggest change I made was to the music page. I decided to give each album its own row across the whole screen rather than have three side by side
as I did in the wireframes. I chose to do this because I wanted to get the image, text and music player for each album on the screen without it feeling
too squashed or crowded.

## Features

  * ### Across all pages
    * Responsive design for different screen sizes while maintaining a clear and attractive layout across all pages.

      Currently due to the scope of the project, when the form is submitted nothing will happen.

      to the bands actual social media pages.

      Due to the scope of this project, when the form is submitted nothing will happen.  
      
## Features I would like to implement 
With the addition of javascript and knowledge of back-end web development I would like to add these further features to the website.
  * When a user signs up with the sign up form on screen they would receive a welcome email and then be included in all future emails 
    for news and updates regarding the band. 
  * When a user fills in the contact form the message would be sent to an email address for the band and management to see allowing a response 
    and or reply.
  * The tour page would be used for a genuine tour with users being able to book their tickets directly through the website, and the buttons 
    changing from *book now* to *sold out* when all the tickets were gone.
  * A page for merchandise where users could browse items, add to a basket and pay for their items through the website. Followed up by a 
    confirmation of purchase email being sent to the user. 

## Technologies Used

  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/) <br>
     Git is used as version control software to add, commit and push code to my GitHub repository where the code is then stored.
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/) <br>

     I have used Google chromes built in developer tools to help with the styling of the site, selecting colors and to help 
    fix any bugs I found.
 
 ## Testing

### Testing User Stories

#### Site owner/band Goals

  **1. I want the site to be attractive, responsive and easy to navigate for the user.**
    
- To get feedback on the visual aspect of the site it has been shared with many friends and family and also other students of code institute
  via the slack portal, the feedback has been very positive. The choice of colors has been 
- I have tested the site on many differnet screen sizes, including, Iphone Xr, Ipad mini, Samsung Galaxy tablet, Macbook air and IMac desktop.
  The site responds well to the different screen sizes and the layout adapts as intended. This is mostly down the bootsrap grid system used when 
  creating the structure of the website in HTML5.
- The Navbar is cleary shown in the header of the site and uses a burger icon for smaller screen sizes. Each link to the differnt pages works as intended
  with a clear intent to what each page is for. 

  **2. I want the site to clearly promote who the band are.**

- Upon entering the website their is a clear and bold header with an off white background and black text promoting the bands name which
  stands out against the rest of the website. 
- Throughout the website there is a video, images, music and a history of the band all to help promote the band and their image.

  **3. I want the user to be able to find the bands social platforms via links in the website.**

- In the footer of every page there are links to the bands social pages including, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Each one will 
  open in a new browser window and take the user directly to the desired soical page.

  **4. I want to give the user the oppurtunity to watch vides and listen to music by the band.**

- On the home page there is a big promotional video of the bands new single that will play when the user interacts with the video controls.
  Below this there is a promotional picture for the new album with a clickable link saying *Listen here.* This will take the user to the bands spotify page.
- On the music page the user has the ability to listen to the music from six different albums using embedded code from spotify. Each album having
  its own set of controls for the user.
